# Old Portfolio Site
### * Both my old and new portfolios are stored in this repo, but this README is referring to the former, which I made from scratch *

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/d2b40b3f-df55-46ea-8bff-a1d587d6726d/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/ymorsi/deploys)

The old site can be accessed at https://www.ymorsi.com/old

Below, descriptions and gifs of certain components of this site can be found.


## JavaScript Title Animation

Using [JavaScript](new/old/docs/js/main.js), I was able to display my name with the creative animation shown above. 

## JavaScript Project Sorter
![JS PS](new/old/docs/assets/img/projex.gif)<br />
Once again using JavaScript, I was able to implement a responsive project sorter. When a user hovers over a project, a bio appears. Pressing on the project leads the user to a new tab with either the Github repository or a YouTube demonstration.

## JavaScript Collapsibles

Once again using JavaScript, I was able to create responsive collapsible information sections.

## Bonus: Photography Page
![JS C](new/old/docs/assets/img/bonus.gif)
As an avid photographer, I love spending my free time adding to my photography collection. While developing my site, I decided to add a [photography page](https://www.ymorsi.com/old/photography.html).
