    <h1>Privacy Policy for SiteBlocker</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: December 2024</p>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
            SiteBlocker ("we", "our", or "the extension") is committed to protecting your privacy. 
            This Privacy Policy explains what data we collect, how we use it, and your rights regarding that data.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Data Collection</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>What we collect:</strong> SiteBlocker only stores the list of website domain names 
            that you explicitly add to your blocklist (e.g., "facebook.com", "youtube.com").
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>How we store it:</strong> This data is stored locally on your device using Chrome's 
            local storage API. The data is stored entirely on your device and never leaves your computer. 
            This allows the extension to work in both normal and incognito browsing modes. We do not 
            have access to this data outside of your browser.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Data Usage</h2>
        <p>
            The list of blocked websites you provide is used solely for the purpose of blocking those 
            websites when you attempt to visit them. We use Chrome's declarativeNetRequest API to 
            redirect your browser to a blocked page when you try to access a site on your blocklist.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>We do NOT:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Collect or transmit any website content</li>
            <li>Track your browsing history</li>
            <li>Monitor your internet activity</li>
            <li>Collect personal information</li>
            <li>Share your data with third parties</li>
            <li>Sell your data</li>
            <li>Use your data for advertising or marketing</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
        <p>
            We do not share, sell, or transfer your data to any third parties. The blocked website list 
            remains on your device only and never leaves your computer. No data is transmitted or 
            synchronized to external servers.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Data Retention</h2>
        <p>
            Your blocked website list is stored for as long as you have the extension installed and 
            the data stored. You can remove websites from your blocklist at any time through the 
            extension's options page or popup. If you uninstall the extension, all stored data will 
            be deleted by Chrome.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Your Rights</h2>
        <p>You have the right to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>View your blocked website list at any time through the extension popup or options page</li>
            <li>Add or remove websites from your blocklist at any time</li>
            <li>Clear all data by uninstalling the extension</li>
            <li>Export your blocklist (data is stored locally on your device)</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Permissions</h2>
        <p>The extension requires the following permissions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Storage:</strong> To store your blocked website list locally on your device. This allows the extension to work in both normal and incognito browsing modes.</li>
            <li><strong>DeclarativeNetRequest:</strong> To block and redirect websites you've added to your blocklist</li>
            <li><strong>Host Permissions (<all_urls>):</strong> To enable blocking for any website you choose to block. 
                This does not grant us access to read website content - it only allows us to apply blocking rules.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>
            SiteBlocker does not use any third-party analytics, tracking services, or external APIs. 
            The extension operates entirely locally on your device.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>
            SiteBlocker does not knowingly collect any personal information from children under the age of 13. 
            The extension only stores website domain names that users explicitly add to their blocklist.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>
            We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify users of any material 
            changes by updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy. We encourage you 
            to review this Privacy Policy periodically.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Contact</h2>
        <p>
            If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or how we handle your data, please 
            contact us through the extension's GitHub repository or support channels.
        </p>
    </div>

            <li>Chrome Web Store Developer Program Policies</li>
            <li>We do not sell or transfer user data to third parties</li>
            <li>We do not use user data for purposes unrelated to the extension's single purpose</li>
